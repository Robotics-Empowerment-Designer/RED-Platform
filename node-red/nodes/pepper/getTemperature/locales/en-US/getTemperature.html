<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="Get skin temperature">
Fetches the highest detected temperature value from the thermal sensor 
and passes it to the upper or lower output depending on the threshold value.

### Outputs
1. Upper output
: payload (number) : Measured temperature (>= threshold).
2. Lower output
: payload (number) : Measured temperature (< threshold).

### Settings
: Temp. threshold (number) : Threshold value.

### Details
As soon as this node is active, it waits for the current highest temperature value from the sensor.
If the measured temperature is above the threshold, the value is output via the upper output. 
If the value is is below the threshold value, the value is output via the lower output. 

**Important:** Only **one** output can be triggered per cycle.
