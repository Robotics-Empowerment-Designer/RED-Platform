Waits until the robot has detected the face of a person.

### Outputs
1. Face detected
: payload ( ) : No additional data
2. Timeout 
:payload (string) : Text "timeout"

### Settings
: Timeout (number) : Time in seconds after which the timeout (2nd output) is triggered, if no face has been detected before that.

### Details
The robot first moves its head to a neutral starting position (looks straight ahead).
Afterwards it then starts the face detection process.

**Important:** Poor lighting conditions impair recognition accuracy. 
In addition, people with masks are only poorly detected.
