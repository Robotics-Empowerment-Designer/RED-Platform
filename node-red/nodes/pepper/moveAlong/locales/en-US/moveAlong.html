**Experimental function! For experienced users only!**

### Settings
: X (number) : Target position for the robot (X axis)
: Y (number) : Target position for the robot (Y axis)
: Theta (number) : Target rotation of the robot in degrees (Theoretically, but practically '2' equals 90Â°)
: Time (number) : Seconds, in which Pepper should perform the movement

### Details
Moves the robot relative to its current position by the specified distance (in meters) 
along the X and/or Y axis. Does not compute an own route, but stops if obstacles are
too close.
