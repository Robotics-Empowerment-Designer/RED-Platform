### Settings
: database ( ) : Database
: Config name (string) : Name of the database.
: Id (number) : Item identifier.
: Name (string) : Name of the item.
: Location (string) : Location of the item.

### Details
This node takes the input data and checks whether it matches an identifier of an item in the database.
If such a match is detected, the location of the corresponding item is sent to the associated output. 
The number of outputs depends on the number of unique locations in the database. 
If no match is found, the input data is sent unchanged to the 'Error' output.

**Advanced users:** If the recognition is successful, both location and name as well as the identifier are output.
While the location can be accessed normally with `{{value}}`, the name can be accessed with `{{name}}` 
and the identifier with `{{id}}`.

### Example
QR Node scans a QR code, the database searches for the corresponding entry and returns the location if it finds it.
The database could be populated with the following data, for example.

| ID          | Name        | Location      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1           | Toast       | Fridge        |
| 2           | Cookies     | Storage       |
