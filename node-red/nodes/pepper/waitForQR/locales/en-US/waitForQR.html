<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="Wait for QR code">
Waits until the robot has recognized a **single** QR code. For this purpose the robot uses 
the camera on its forehead. After successful recognition, the flow continues.

### Outputs
1. QR code detected
: payload (string) : Data of the QR code
2. Timeout
: payload (string) : Text "timeout"

### Settings
: Allow all inputs (bool) : See details
: Timeout (number) : Time in seconds after which the timeout (2nd output) is triggered, if no QR code has been recognized before that.

### Details
By default, only QR codes for the household scenario are recognized. 
If all possible QR codes should be recognized, the option `Allow all inputs` must be activated. 
Only then will the data from all QR Codes be routed to the output.

**Important:** Only one QR Code is recognized per cycle, if several have been recognized, 
the first QR Code is always selected. This should be avoided.
