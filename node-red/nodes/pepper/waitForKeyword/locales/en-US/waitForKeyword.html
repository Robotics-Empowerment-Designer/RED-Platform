Waits until the robot has recognized the specified word sequence. 
While the speech recognition is active, the robot's eyes light up blue. 
After successful recognition, the eyes light up green.

### Outputs
1. Keyword outputs
: payload (string) : Recognized word or recognized sentence
2. Timeout
: payload (string) : Text "timeout"

### Settings
: Language (string) : Language of the entered text.
: Detection threshold (number) : Detection probability, how "sure" the robot has to be that the spoken text matches the configured word or sentence.
: Keywords (string) : Words or sentences to be recognized.
: Pepper's inquiry (string) : Words or sentences that the robot should say in case of failed recognition (are selected randomly).
: Timeout (number) : Time in seconds after which the timeout (lowest output) is triggered if the speech recognition was not successful.


### Details
The robot's eyes light up blue as soon as speech recognition is active. When a word is recognized, the eyes light up green. 
The `detection threshold` setting determines how confident the robot is that the spoken text matches the configured word or phrase.
If the recognition fails, the robot asks, randomly selecting a word or phrase from the `Pepper's inquiry` setting. 
The `timeout` setting determines after how many seconds the timeout (lowest output) is triggered.
This time starts from the moment the speech recognition is activated and is not reset if Pepper asks for it.

**Important:** The robot does not wait until all words/phrases are detected, but only the first detected word/phrase.
