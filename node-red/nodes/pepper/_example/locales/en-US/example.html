<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="Wait time">
In this file you should explain what your node does, how it should be used and what parameters it has.
This file has full Markdown support (see https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/help-style-guide for more information)
The first paragraph is used for both the short description (when you hover over the node in the node list) and the full description.
The following text is just an example of what the description could look like (copied from the wait node).

Waits until the specified duration (in seconds) has elapsed and then continues the flow.

### Settings
: Text (number) : Waiting time in seconds.
