<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="Stop">
Marks the end of a flow. The button on the right side of the node can be used to manually stop the currently active flow.

### Details
Signals to the application that the current flow has ended. If the loop setting (in the start-node) is activated, 
as soon as this node is reached, it jumps back to the start. If the active sequence is stopped 
via the button, most actions are interrupted, others such as animations are still played in full. 
As soon as these are finished the flow will also be stopped normally.
The tablet displays the default image after the stop.
